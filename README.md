# ConvNetCL4J
OpenCL Accelerated Deep Learning for Java using Aparapi

This is still WIP.  

Currently done:  
Convolutional Layer  
Transpose Convolution Layer  
ReLU Layer, LeakyReLU  
SGD  
SGD-Momentum  
MSE Loss  
Charbonnier Loss  


*High priority:*  
Add gradient checks and unit tests


Near future plans:  
Other Rectifiers (ELU, etc)  
Max Pooling Layer  
Fully Connected Layer  
Dilated Convolution Layer  
Adam
